  <center><h2>Coders in the Kitchen</h2></center>
  <p id="first">
      DBC is a great place to learn code and different languages, but it’s also a place to develop valuable learning strategies.  Before starting DBC, I knew I was going to come in and see an immediate impact on my coding skills, but after watching Shereef’s Fireside Chat, I realized I’ll be walking away with much more to offer than just knowing how to code.
    </p>
    <p id="second">
        In my first cultural blog, I wanted to talk about a few different learning approaches; Restaurant and Kitchen Mindsets.
    </p>
    <p id="third">
        First, there is the Restaurant Mindset.  In this style, you would look at DBC as a package of things that you paid for (like ordering food at a restaurant).  If DBC were a restaurant, the menu would say that I would be learning Ruby, Java, HTML, and for desert I would be getting a job.  Sounds great right?  Well.. kind of.   While this consumer like mindset might be nice when ordering food at a restaurant, as a learning approach heading into DBC, it isn’t too effective.
    </p>
    <p>
        So if the Restaurant Mindset isn’t the best way to approach DBC, what about a Kitchen Mindset? A Kitchen Mindset is basically a way of saying: “we are all in this mess together.”  Some chefs(students) in the kitchen might know more recipes that others, some chefs(students) might have never picked up a frying pan in their life, but what makes this mindset so effective is that we all have each others backs and are all working together to achieve the same goal.  Shereef mentions DBC only working if everyone walks in the door each day, ready to own it.  Having played college soccer, I especially related to this because we needed everyone on the team to come together in order to win a conference championship.  We needed everyone to have that Kitchen Mindset, willing to bring their best effort day in and out.  This is the same attitude DBC is expecting us to bring and I look forward to it.
    </p>
    <p>
        To conclude this blog, I wanted to end on a quote from Shereef that I think closes it all out well.  “There are going to be days when your going to say to yourself, this is not what I ordered.. But as long as you can get past those days and fight through it, you will find success.”
    </p>
     <p>
        Being new to the coding world I was nervous heading into DBC because I felt like I might not understand the material and hold people back.  After watching this Fireside chat though, my nerves are more at ease knowing that if I don’t know what I’m cooking, I at least have a bunch of good chefs to help me out.
