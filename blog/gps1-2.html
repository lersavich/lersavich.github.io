    <p>What is Pair Programming?<br>
        Pair programming is the concept of working with another programmer with established roles.
        There are significant benefits to pair programming, such as: solidifying knowledge or gaining knowledge from your partner,
        increased scrutiny of code, sanity checking of concepts.
    </p>
    <p>Why is Pair Programming Important at DBC?<br>
        Pair programming is important DBC because it introduces a concept that is common in Ruby development.  It also has the benefit
        of reinforcing learned concepts through the process of walking someone else through them.
    </p>
