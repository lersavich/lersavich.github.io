  <p><b><center>I Finally Git It</center></b></p>
 <p>
      Imagine a 10 year old self playing against your best friend in a game of checkers. The game is close and you’re at that stage where you spend about 15 minutes holding down a checker with one finger, frantically looking around the board making sure that if you let go, your buddy isn’t going to be able to steal your piece.  You finally let go of your checker, only to realize you made the dumbest move possible and you get double jumped immediately.  Your buddy starts to laugh and tells you how bad you are while you sit there all fired up, realizing you just made the move that lost you the game.
    </p>
    <p>
         Well, what if there was a way to start over from that move?  A way to go back to a snap shot in time and have a redo.  Unlike your best friend who would probably tell you to take a hike if you asked him to replay the move, “Version Control” WOULD allow you to go back however many moves you needed in order to get the Win.
    </p>
    <p>
         What Version Control does is it keeps track of any changes you make to a file and stores it in a timeline like fashion.  If you mess up, get stuck, or don’t like where things are headed in your code, Version Control allows you to scroll back to any period in time and start over.  You could also think about Version Control like a Checkpoint in a video game like Mario.  If you are close to beating the game but die, thankfully you don’t have to start the game over, you just pick up where you left off and save yourself hours of time.  Version Control is that checkpoint.
    </p>
    <p>
       Now that you understand the concept of Version Control, you might be asking what’s up with the blog title?  “I finally Git It.”  No that is not a spelling mistake, “Git” is one of the most popular Version Control systems out there and is especially important when working in large groups.  Imagine that you are working with 100 devleopers on an iPhone App.  Everyone gets emailed the master copy, but there are still tons of changes and fixes to be made.  How do all 100 people work together and make edits at the same time?  Do they hit the ‘save’ button and email all the staff the newly saved document?  What if someone makes changes to a line of code that then causes another persons code to go askew?  This is why Git is so important. Rather than everyone working on the master copy at the same time, each person can create “Branches” off of that main copy.  Think of Git like a tree, with the master copy being the trunk of the tree that stores all good code that works, the branches are being used to add on to the trees performance and fix things.  100 people working on the same trunk would be impossible.  But 100 people all working on their own separate branches, using the master copy as the trunk to make corrections isn’t.
    </p>
     <p>
       So where do these developers upload their work if they don’t just hit the save button?  This is where GitHub comes in.  While everything you did with Git is locally on your computer, GitHub is a way for your work to be seen online.  Think of Git like a flash drive that only you can see locally and GitHub like Dropbox that can be shared online.  In the example I gave above with the 100 developers working on an iPhone app, they would use GitHub to monitor their project, noting when new code was added, what was changed, and what still needs to be done.

       And yes, I might have set a world record for metaphors in one blog.. I never said I was Bill Shakespeare.
