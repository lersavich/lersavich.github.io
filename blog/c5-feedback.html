During each week at Dev Bootcamp, we are required to have at least 2 pairing sessions with another person in our cohort, to complete challenges that are given to us.  In this short blog, I’m going to talk about what it’s like to pair with others to solve challenges, as well as the positives and negatives that come with pairing.  I will also talk about the process of giving and receiving feedback after pairing sessions.
</p>
<p>
First, when you pair with someone it is always interesting to see how they go about solving a problem.  Some like to take a more analytical approach, while some like to dive right in and see what happens.  Overall, I find that pairing with others provides me with a great opportunity to get inside their brain and see how they pick apart problems.  It’s really helpful because there’s always multiple ways to solve the problems we are given, so to do something in a different way than I normally would, only helps mold and shape my knowledge of Ruby for the better.
</p>
<p>
What’s kind of funny about pairing, is it can be both rewarding and frustrating at the same time.  I just wrote about how it’s really beneficial to pair with someone, to see how they solve a solution, but that’s also what makes it frustrating.  Sometimes I find myself stuck in my own ways, so when something new gets brought to the table, I’ll think my way is better(even though it’s not), and it can get frustrating.  On the flip side of that, it always ends up as a rewarding experience after we finish because not only do I know how to attack the solution my way, I also know another way to go about the material.
</p>
<p>
Last, I want to talk about feedback after pairing.  DBC stresses the importance of leaving; Actionable, Specific, and Kind and I’ve found it to be very useful.
 Normally when I read my feedback, I’m nervous that someone will rip me to shreds, but luckily that hasn't happen yet.  Something I always try and do with my feedback is implement it into my next pairing session, so if one person thought I was a little quiet, I will try and take on more of a driver responsibility the next time around and be more vocal.  If someone thought I needed to work on my knowledge on instance variables, I will make sure that I don’t get a comment regarding variables again.
</p>
<p>
The one thing that I find difficult at times when writing feedback to others is how not to sound mean.  Sometimes I will have a perfect pairing partner and things will go great, but when I’m writing something actionable like: “I think you should look more into classes” I just hope they don’t read it like I’m being smug.  Pretty silly, I agree.

</p>
<p>
All in all, I think that the pairing and feedback system DBC has implemented has been very beneficial to my understanding and learning of Ruby.
