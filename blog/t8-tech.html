  <center><h2>How does the Internet work?</h2></center>
<p>
The internet is used by millions all over the world.  We use it to check the weather, send out emails, and stream movies.. but do you know how the internet actually works?  Well DBC asked us that question this week and in this Technical Blog I want to explain how you are able to read this blog post right now.
</p>

<p>
The internet is basically just a wire.  It’s an extremely simplified answer, but let’s run with it for this example. (The internet could also use satellite to communicate between another) The wires purpose is to allow two different computers to communicate to each other by  using their servers.
</p>

<p>
Let’s say you want to go to espn.com to read some articles on your favorite sports team. Each one of those pages, and any website you’ll ever visit on earth acts like a file in the servers hard drive.  In order for our computers to even send and receive information we first need to have an IP address.  An IP address, is a unique string of numbers separated by periods that identifies each computer using the Internet Protocol(“IP”) to communicate over a network.  So much like we use street addresses to send mail, we use IP addresses to send and receive information online.
</p>

<p>
One important thing to note is that since our personal computers don’t have/create their own IP address.  Because of this, we rely on Internet Service Providers(ISPs) like Comcast or RCN to deliver us an internet signal. These ISPs will in return allow us to turn our computers, phones, televisions, into “clients” which will allow us to access the server, to then use the internet for whatever we feel like doing that day.
