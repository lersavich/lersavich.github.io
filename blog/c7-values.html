    “When you think of the times in your life where you’ve been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, which of the following values come to mind?”
</p>

<p>
This week at DBC, the question above was proposed to us and when I look back at my life, I can definitely identify some values that always seem to be around when I’m the most happy.
</p>

<p>
To me these 3 values sum of everything you really need in your life:

<ol>
<li>Health</li>
<li>Confidence</li>
<li>Close relationships/Friendship</li>
</ol>


<p>
I choose health at #1 because during college, I had a seizure on an airplane flying back from a vacation and it was easily the scariest thing I have ever experience.  I thought I was going to die, the flight had to emergency land, and everyone on the plane was crying as I’m being carried out on a stretcher.  I even got a call from the Pilot at the hospital, because he even thought I wasn't going to make it.
</p>

<p>
Before the incident I had always been in perfect health, not even a broken bone or stitches, so this definitely caught me off guard.
</p>

<p>
Afterwards, I didn’t feel like myself for a while and I was always worried about dying.  My outlook was always the “worst care scenario” to everything that would happen.  Headache?  It was probably cancer.  Cough?  I probably had Pneumonia.. and so on.
</p>

<p>
Looking back on it now, I am glad it happened as I’ve learned to truly appreciate each day of my  life and not worry about the little things as much.  It was a dark time for sure, but definitely made me realize that my health has a direct impact on my happiness.
</p>


<p>
Next on the list is confidence.  Looking back at what I’ve already written, I realized that I have done this challenge a little backwards.  Rather than looking  at the happiest times of our lives and identifying the values that were present, I went the opposite.  I took a look at one of the worst times in my life and noticed the values that were missing and those were health and confidence.  Confidence in your own self is huge to living a happy/positive life.
</p>

<p>
I also chose close relationships/friendship because where would we all be without friends and family?  Close relationships/friendships is something I have always been lucky to have.  and is key to living a happy life.  When things got rough for me after the plane incident, I could always turn to my friends and family when I wasn't feeling the greatest.
