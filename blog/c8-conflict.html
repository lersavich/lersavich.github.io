  <p><b><center>Conflict</center></b></p>

 <p>
For this week's cultural blog, DBC wants us to discuss a time we ran into a conflict.  It then wants us to ask ourselves:
<ul>
<li>What was the source of the conflict?</li>
<li>What basic emotions did you feel upon analyzing the conflict?</li>
<li>What actions did you take to resolve your conflict?</li>
<li>If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?</li>
<li>What did you learn from this experience? </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The most recent time I ran into conflict was during a pick-up basektball game at XSport a couple weeks ago.  I was playing 3v3, and the guy I was matched up against kept fouling everytime I would drive on him.  Now like I said, this is pickup basketball so your used to hard fouls, but the guy I'm going up against is actually swinging his arms at me as I drive, and it starts take a toll on my body and mind.  The more he fouls, the more I want to score on him and the more chippy it got.  That chippyness soon turned into anger, which quickly turned into pushing and shoving match over who needs to "take it easy".
</p>

<p>
What basic emotions did I feel upon analyzing the conflict? Looking back at it now, it was completely pointless to argue with this guy.  We both just wanted to play basketball and have fun, but our competiveness got in the way of both of us and escaladed things.
</p>

<p>
What actions did I take to resolve the conflict? Unfortunately for me the actions I took were the wrong ones.  Rather than just letting things go and not getting to upset about the guys obvious fouls, I let it get to my head and it effected the way I played.
</p>

<p>
If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything? I would do a lot of things differently if I could go back and hange things.  Right off bat, after the guys first hard foul I should have said something.  You never want to be the guy complaining about fouls, but for this instance I think should have just calmly said to the guy to relax a little bit.  Instead, I kept it all internal.. let him foul me about 10 more times to the point I was angry.. I never called a foul on him to let him know otherwise.. and it eventually led to a shoving match.  If only I spoke my mind early on, rather than letting things escalate, I would have been better off.
</p>

<p>
What did I learn from this experience?  I learned that I need to be open with others if something is bothering me and I shouldn't keep everything to myself.  During the basketball game, I only got angrier as the game went on.  I tried to avoid conflict by not saying anything, but that only created more conflict.
