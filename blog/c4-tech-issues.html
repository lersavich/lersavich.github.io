When DBC gave us the exercise to blog about something wrong in the tech world, I knew I’d write about Net Neutrality.
</p>
<p>
Imagine that it’s 2016 and you’re at home looking for a movie to watch on Netflix.  You take the usual 3 hours to pick something out and when you finally hit play, nothing plays.  The load screen comes up, but it’s stuck at 2% for about 10 minutes.
</p>
<p>
This very well could be our future.
</p>
<p>
The Federal Communications Commission(FCC) is looking to turn the internet into a utility, much like gas or electricity, so they can regulate the internet and charge a fee for it.
</p>
<p>
In short, they want to charge companies like Netflix a fee for sending us the data that makes our movies to play.
</p>
<p>
The cycle is this:  You click play on Netflix.  Netflix then sends that data over to an Internet Service Provider(ISP) like Comcast or Time Warner, and then Comcast delivers that data over to you.
</p>
<p>
With the way net neutrality is set up now, all ISP’s must deliver data at the same rate.  So whether you watch something on Netflix, Amazon, or Hulu, they all get delivered at the same speed.
</p>
<p>
If the FCC controls our internet access what happens to that cycle?  You click play on Netflix, Netflix is forced to pay a fee for them to send that data over to the ISP, you most likely have to pay for money to use Netflix, and then finally the ISP delivers you the data.
</p>
<p>
Basically the internet will turn into a highway, with slow and fast lanes.  Companies that decide to pay extra money to ISP’s, will have their content delivered to you quicker, than others that can’t afford to, or choose not to.
</p>
<p>
So if Hulu pays more money that Neflix for the ISP to deliver their data, Hulu will be faster than Netflix.
