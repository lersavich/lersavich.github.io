  <p><b><center>Stereotype Threat</center></b></p>
  <p id="first">
      For this week’s Cultural Blog, DBC has asked us to conduct our own research on the topic of  Stereotype Threat.  What is Stereotype threat you ask?  It all began by a man named Cluade Steele, who performed the first experiments showing that stereotype threat can undermine intellectual performance.   The definition states that it’s a situational predicament in which people are or feel themselves to be at risk of confirming negative stereotypes about their social group.
    </p>

    <p>
        While doing my research on Stereotype threat, I found these examples very helpful in better understanding the impact it has.
      </p>

     <li>Here are some examples of Stereotype threat:

 <ul>

 <li>Women perform worse on math tests when they think the test will produce gender differences. (Spencer, Steele, & Quinn, 1999)</li>
 <br>

  <li>White men perform worse on math tests when they think they are competing with Asians. (Aronson et al., 1999)</li>
  <br>

   <li>Black students perform worse than white students on the GRE when they think that the test is measuring their abilities, but when black students are told that the test is not measuring their abilities (when told the test is not yet valid or reliable), they perform just as well as white students. (Steele and Aronson, 1995)</li>
   <br>

    <li>Black athletes do worse than white athletes when they are led to believe that a game of miniature golf tests "sport strategic intelligence," but when the test is framed as a measure of "natural athletic ability," the white athletes do worse than the black athletes.</li>
    <br>

     <li>Female chess players perform worse than male chess players when they are aware that they are playing against a male opponent. When they are (falsely) led to believe that they are playing against another woman, they perform just as well as the male players. (Maass, D'Etolle, & Cadinu, 2008)</li>
     <br>

 </ul> </li>

      <p>
      It’s really crazy if you think about it isn't it?  How can Stereotype threat be that powerful to actual effect test scores and performance in others?

      </p>
      <p>
       When I look back at my life, I can’t really think of a time that I have been impacted by Stereotype threat but I can imagine how tough it can be to overcome some of those challenges.  I’ve always hated taking test and consider myself a “poor test taker”, so I can’t imagine having the added pressure of Stereotype threat, on top of the anxiety you already feel before a big test.
      </p>
      <p>

        One of the questions DBC wanted us to reflect on was if we could identify ways to make others feel more conformable and reduce the impact of stereotype threat, and I really don’t think I have an answer. I think in life you should always treat others how you want to be treated, and I think that if we all spent each day living up to that, I’d hope stereotype threat, wouldn't have as big of an impact as it does today.
