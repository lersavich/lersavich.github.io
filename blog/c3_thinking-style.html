      Before starting Dev Bootcamp, I was asked to take Anthony Gregoric’s learning style quiz that would give me a better idea on how I go about studying and learning new material.  After completing the test, I was given the result of a Concrete Random Learner.

    <p id="second">
        According to Gregoric, a Concrete Random learner likes to experiment in order to find answers, take risks, use their intuition, and solve problems independently.  A Concrete Random learner will learn best when they are able to use trial-and-error approaches, when they are able to compete with others, and our given the opportunity to work through the problems themselves.  It is also hard for Concrete Random learners to have; restrictions and limitations, formal reports, routines, re-doing things more than once, keeping detailed records, showing how they got an answer, choosing only one answer, and having no options.

       Now when I reflect back on the first 3 weeks of DBC I can see that my biggest struggle during phase-0 has been time-boxing, and it reflects directly back to me being a Concrete Random learner.
    </p>
    <p>
       As I mentioned above, Concrete Random learners like using trial and error when coming up with a solution.  I have found that when studying new material, I will sometimes go over the 30 minutes I set aside to time-box and find myself digging into rabbit holes for hours at a time.  Rather than letting my mind wonder off, I need to work on staying focused on one task/question at a time.  Moving forward, I believe that if I were to rely more on time-boxing, I will have a much easier time going through the exercises, rather than bog my mind down with new questions I stumbled on to.

        Before I close out, I wanted to touch on the difference between a growth and fixed mindsets.  The growth mindset believes that intelligence can be developed while a fixed mindset believes that intelligence is static.  It is extremely important for me to continue to have a growth mindset throughout DBC.  A Growth mindset embraces challenges, doesn't give up easily, and fights back in the face of setbacks.  With me being the new coder on campus, I’m running into new challenges and setbacks daily, and if I were to embrace a fixed mindset.. I don’t think I’d make it out of DBC.

        It is important for me to overachieve and go beyond my expectations(growth mindset), rather than plateau early and full short of my full potential(fixed mindset).
